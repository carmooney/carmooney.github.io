<p>I'm an aspiring graphic designer from Westchester, NY. Currently I am a junior at SUNY Oswego, where I am working towards my BFA in Graphic Design and minor an in Illustration. When Iâ€™m not designing, you can find me working in the admissions office where I currently intern for their Admissions Promise Program as well as a tour guide. My inspirations also come from being the Social Media Director and Graphic Designer for SUNY Oswego's Cut the Craft.
</p> 

<p>CM Creatives Co. started in the middle of lockdown starting with stickers and prints. Today, I manage the CM Creatives Co. Etsy shop while still offering freelancing services in portraits, stickers, prints, logos, and apparel all while working towards my degree. After graduation, I hope to continue my goals of expanding my freelance business to new clients and customers by doing what I love every day.</p> 

<p>As a designer, I have developed many skills both in and outside of the world of graphic design. I am efficient in the Adobe Creative Suite, Procreate, and Cricut Design Space. I also have knowledge in both HTML and CSS which I am currently developing my skills in. I am eager to learn new things and I love taking on new and exciting challenges!</p>


<p>I would love to work with you and bring your dream project to life! Please contact me for inquires.</p>
