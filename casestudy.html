            <p>Baker buddies originated from a collaborative web media project where the objective was to create an article list website of our choosing. One of the main goals of this project was to create not only a brand, but build a live website using html and css. <a href=https://web-design-oswego-art-dept.github.io/f20-317-collaborative-project-mjc><span class="bold">Visit the<span class="italic"> baker buddies </span> website.</span></a></p>

           <h2> What is <span class="italic">Baker Buddies</span>? </h3>

           <p><span class="italic">Baker Buddies</span> is an interactive baking website that promotes simple and easy baking in a group setting. Each recipe is divided into different roles for every member of the group. It's a great way to connect with others while making something delicious! <span style="font-style: italic;">baker buddies</span> can be used by anyone, but our main audience catered towards SUNY Oswego students who are looking for easy baking while being social with others.
           </p>

        <h3>Brand Identity</h3>
        <p>As a group of designers, we understand how important it is to create a brand that represents the aesthetic and goals of our website. Since the beginning, we wanted our audience to feel welcomed by our website so that they can engage with our recipes and create something memorable with their teammates. Baking should be positive experience and we wanted our website to send that message. </p>

       <div class="bblogo"><img src="assets/bblogoanotation.png" alt="Annotated baker buddies logo"></div>

        <p><span class="italic">baker buddies</span> is presented in all lowercase to make the audience relaxed and at ease while using the site. The curves in the slab serif show that baker buddies are fun and playful. In the middle of the typography there is a chef hat graphic to add visual interest to our logo. When users see a chef hat they will know that they have come to a baking site. Like our website, we wanted our color palette to be relaxed and playful at the same time. This is why our team opted for a muted color palette, with a pop of the red-orange as an accent color. This palette will not overwhelm users when they enter the site which is important so our team of bakers don't feel overwhelmed while in the kitchen.

        <div class="textright"><h3>Homepage</h3>
        <p>Our homepage contains an article list of our most recent recipes as well as the phrase, “designed for group baking” which can be seen throughout the website.</p></div>

        <div class="bblogo"><img src="assets/bbabout.png" alt="screenshot of baker buddies about page"></div>
        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>The about page explains the mission of baker buddies as well as the importance of working together and baking with others. On the left side of the page there is an image of two young adults to help connect to our primary audience, SUNY Oswego students.</p>

        <h3>Article List</h3>
        <p>Our recipe page contains an article list of all of our recipes. Staying on brand with our primary audience, all of our recipes are named after SUNY Oswego. In place of photographs of the deserts, we opted to use illustrations for the thumbnail so there would be unity among all of the imagery. Each article box animations to a dashed line when you hover over it as an interactive element to our website.</p>

        </video>
        <h3>Individual Recipe Page</h3>
        <p>Each recipe page includes a description of the desert and an illustration. They are also provided with the ingredients, tools and directions they need to create the dish. To promote group baking, each teammate has a role so everyone is working. Images of the tools are provided in a grid format so that users can easily see what they need. Since the original recipe was not created by baker buddies, we credited the original baker at the bottom of the recipe, so they receive the proper credit.</p>

        <h3>404 Page</h3>
        <p>If the user is misdirected, they will receive our 404 page. Staying on brand, there is an animation of a oven on fire with text that reads, “Something went wrong in the kitchen”. There is a link at the bottom that redirects to the homepage.  </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This was the first website I have completed. As a new web designer, this project helped me learn many new skills both in html and CSS. I am very proud of the work my team and I have done to make baker buddies a fun experience for everyone. </p>
