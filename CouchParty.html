<p>Social media campaign designed for Vote Oswego. This campaign was deployed onto social media and twitter in the weeks rising up to the election. Couch Parties are a COVID-19 safe event where friends can meet up virtually to register to vote and figure out their plan for the upcoming election. Some of these were for specific events that Vote Oswego hosted while others were materials to give to organizations on campus to host their own. </p>
